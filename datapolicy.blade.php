                <p> <span style="padding-left: 30px;">7.1.1. Necessary Cookies: </p> 
                <p> <span style="padding-left: 60px;">7.1.1.1. Login cookies – to distinguish you from other Partners. The information they use is an alphanumeric session key to help us recognise you when you return to the Virtual Hub. It will typically last for two weeks from the time you log in if you remain logged in, or it will be deleted immediately when you log out. </p>
               <p> <span style="padding-left: 60px;">7.1.1.2. Security cookies – this is a cookie that prevents cross site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) attacks, a common type of web-based attack in which a malicious website is able to perform actions/requests on your behalf on the main website/system. CSRF cookies are anonymous and do not contain any information that can be used to identify the user. </p>
               <p> <span style="padding-left: 60px;">7.1.1.3. Cookie consent cookie – to remember that you have seen and dismissed the cookie notification alert, accepting the use of cookies. It will typically last for 12 months. </p>

          <p> <span style="padding-left: 60px;">7.1.2.1.

                <p> <span style="padding-left: 30px;">7.3.1. Not accepting our Optional Cookies will still allow you to access to all features of our Site, but will prevent us from collecting analytic information that will help us develop the Site. </p>

How can I be sure my data is secure? 
 <p align="justify">8.1. We take appropriate technical and operational measures to protect the personal information the Virtual Hub gathers and processes about you. You should always bear in mind that there is no such thing as 100% information security. For example, communications over the internet and mobile phone networks are not completely secure and we cannot accept responsibility for unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond its control. You also need to take steps to protect your log in details, use anti-virus software and to act sensibly when providing personal information. If you have any concerns, then do contact us. </p>
